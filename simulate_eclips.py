# at t=0 it is at a "near-full near-node" position and the shadow sweeps horizontally.
#
# For an accurate orbital simulator you can re-use the Kepler solver from earlier code.
# Here we choose an event-centered geometry: Moon center at (d_EM,0,0) in Earth-centered coords,
# and the shadow axis passes across with lateral offset sweep to produce an eclipse.
#
# But we want realistic distances for angular calculations, so we create a simple parametric sweep
# where the moon center vector in Earth-centered coords moves slightly in Y so that the shadow center
# relative to moon crosses the disk. This simplifies the demonstration but keeps angular correctness.
